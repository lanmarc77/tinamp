## Notes
Whatever flashes on the display can usually be setup using the D-PAD.

You select an audio book or start/pause playing with OK (usually button A).

BACK (usually B) pauses or switches from pause to chapter (=file) selection. BACK also switches back to the previous screen.

If you are in the audio book selection screen and press BACK the application will quit and shutdown the device. If you wish to keep using the device press and hold SELECT.

When the device is playing an audio book the volume can be setup using the D-PAD. For as long as this volume overlay screen is shown the OK button will scroll through different sub menus of the overlay for setting up sleep timer, play speed, equalizer or book repeat mode.

After 15s of no button input the device will switch off the screen to get as much playtime out of the battery as possible. If no audio book is playing (incl. the audio book is paused) the device will shutdown after 120s of no button input. If the screen is off when the device shuts down the screen will stay off. Very useful for the sleep timer.

A global settings menu can be reached by navigating to the first audio book and pressing the D-PAD down. This allows setting up screen rotation, screen brightness, screen saver mode, font type, A-B switch, deleting of bookmarks, reduced mode.
